gofrido command line tool
=========================

Since version 2.* you DON'T HAVE TO use ``$ python3 -m gofri.generate_project <project-name>``, there's a lightweight CLI app which can create Gofri projects.
You can also use it instead of ``generate.py`` in your project.

To generate a project just type ``gofrido new <project-name>``.
